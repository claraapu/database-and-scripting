# Example of a for loop

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

for i in numbers:
    print(i)

# Example of a while loop

i = 10

while i > 5:
    i -= 1
    print(i)


# Using a for loop and if statemnt, print the following numbers: 15, 55, 75, 150

numbers = [15, 55, 75, 150]

for i in numbers:
    if 1 == 1:
